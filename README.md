# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This study guide provides keen information for beginner coders. This was created to store the information and make it accessible for studying. It solves the problem of having to look at many different resources to find the basic information for coding. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a website.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about the following topics HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
